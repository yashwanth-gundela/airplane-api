# airplane-api

This API is used to create a microservice API to help us understand and track how a particular personâ€™s flight path may be queried. (Part of volume finance assessment).

## API Endpoint

### "POST /calculate"

This endpoint accepts a JSON payload consisting of a list of flights and returns the first and last airports in the flight path as a JSON object. If a cycle (a chain of airports forming a loop) is detected in the flight paths, it outputs a JSON object with an error message.

- **URL**: `/calculate`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body**: A JSON array of flights, where each flight is an array with two elements: the source airport code and the destination airport code.

### Success request example

{
  "flights": [
    ["ATL", "EWR"],
    ["SFO", "MCO"],
    ["MCO", "NYC"],
    ["EWR", "SFO"]
  ]
}
```

Output JSON:

```json
["ATL", "NYC"]
```

### Failed request example
